<h3 id="what-is-a-cryptocurrency">What is a cryptocurrency?</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency that uses the field of cryptography to ensure its security.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are useful due to the emphasis on security, and often use the technology of blockchain to implement the different forms of security.</p>
<p>The difference from cryptocurrencies and any other form of currency is the fact that cryptocurrencies are decentralized. This means that there is no central governing authority that owns “all” the currency and wallets/exchanges/transactions do not use the banking systems that normal currencies use.</p>
<h3 id="block-chain-cryptocurrency">Block-chain cryptocurrency:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Called IOTA <a href="https://www.iota.org/">Link</a></li>
<li>Focuses completely on using the concept of <code>tangles</code> in <code>directed acyclic graphs</code>.</li>
<li>Based on cryptography, so security can be assumed/held (once verified)</li>
<li>Founder is Sonstebo, who’s issue was with the fact that blockchain takes too long to verify transactions.</li>
<li>Solution / IOTA’s main idea: The IOTA “tangle” says that to place a transaction on the blockchain, the issuer must confirm two randomly selected previous transactions, which each themselves will have 2 transactions that would be solved before being valid.</li>
<li>This allows for a web of confirmation</li>
<li>IOTA hasn’t been built yet, but is currently being backed by important companies</li>
</ul>
