## Lecture 1 - Intro && Who wants to be a billionaire?

Cloud is the future for tech.

Company's success has a lot of different causes, but **Positive feedback** and **network externalities** can help elevate a product a lot. Especially if you have competing superior rivals (think industry disrupting products)

The idea of success from **The Long Tail**:
Ages ago when distribution, marketing and just getting products out was hard, companies preferred to only care about the 20% of the content (specific to media) which was where the majority of the consumers lie and use. However, there exists the long tail, that has 80% of the content, which was previously ignored as the old companies found it not cost effective to market the long tail to users.

Companies like amazon, google etc marketed this long tail and focused on it (imagine user suggestions). This is how their profits would increase so much. They'd grab the 20% user share from the peaks, then spread that over to the 80% shares for less marketable content.

They used things like customer reviews and recommendations and ratings to learn what groups of people prefer what, and pushed this recommendation down the long tails allowing other users to buy these too.

**Debates about the long tail**:

- Does it really exist?
- What % is it, and does that change over time?
- Is it a % or a sliding window
- The actual shape of the curve is debated as well.

**Some answers**:
People have shown that the tails have either gotten longer or are worth more, where you have more niche content basically.

## How do competitive markets or distrupting markets work?

Situation:
You're an old big boi company, and there's a market demand that you're not only meeting, but exceeding in terms of resources and skill. This allows you to mostly set the price and value of your services and products.

After a few years, a new company launches as a competitor in your field, maybe not the same quality as yours (_yet_) but seems more lightweight and a bit cheaper.

Overtime this company can grow while you grow, but it will be seen as the underdog and cheaper solution. At some point this will then grow enough to meet market demand and start taking away at your customers / bottom line.

**Two types of innovation:**

- Sustaining innovations: Incremental improvements on existing products and services. It's attractive to existing customers and businesses, and eventually you will offer more than a customer wants (is that bad or good?)
- Disruptive innovations: Perform less well than existing products, with lower quality and possibly less sophistication. However it's going to be simpler, cheaper and possibly more user-friendly.

**Dilemma with innovation**: Will just sticking to your roots bring you down? Sometimes it's worth trying new things or thinking differently before someone else does it!

## Platform business:

Old internet companies were full pipelines, that started with something and gave you an end result.

However new tech companies prefer to be platforms rather than services. For example Uber and AirBnB are platform businesses and create an online **venue** for matching demand and supply to workers.
This allows them to get money from both sides if they can.

An advantage of platform businesses is that **they remove the idea that gigs in a gig market are hard to get**. They opened up the market by:

- Creating low barrier to entry
- Aggregated supply together, providing an easy place to find demand
- Large number of customers join the platform makes the consumers/suppliers very glad and more interested in joining.

This allows the workers who worked on commision, worked on "gigs", to be able to find their gigs a lot easier and make finding work more simple rather than spending time looking around.

**Gig Market:** Short term, single contracts (cars, concerts, photographers etc) rather than fulltime job focused.
**how uber/airbnb helped**: Helped people find their demand and helped demanders find their supply and took a little bit from both along the way.

**Recommender Systems:** Basically different examples of algorithms that recommend you data to pull you into the long tail.

1. Raw Data Based: People's likes, ratings, followings and user surveys lead to better recommendatiosn
2. Passive / Implicit based: People's behaviour, their viewing history and viewing times, having lists of user interactions and grouping "types" of users together.

# Lecture 3&4 Economics of the internet

**Macroeconomics**: Large-scale or general economic factors like interest rates and national productivity

**Microeconomics**: Behaviour of individuals and firms in making decisions aregarding allocation of resources, and the interactions among these individuals and firms.

## How do you define a fair price for a good or a service?

You can base this on

- Consumer's desire and willingness to pay a price for the service.
- **market demand is the total** of what everyone in the market wants.

The value of an object changes per person, for example buying a falafel when you're hungry vs buying one when youre full. the worth to you changes.

We can plot the market demand as a function of quantity vs quality.

**If you drew a graph of Quantity(x) vs prices(y), the supply would increase linearly in a straight line at a 1-1 trend. More supply would be available at higher prices.**

**The slope of demand on a Quantity(x) vs Price(y) scale would be a line sloping linerarly downwards, highest prices at the lowest quantity and lowest price at the highest quantity** Imagine this as the opposite direction of the Supply line.

## Equilibirum Price:

The point where demand and supply cross is the market equilibrium.
This is the point when the **quantity demand equals quantity supplied** Q'. The corresponding Price is P'

In an **ideal** market, we'd expect Q' products to be sold at Price P'.

In the cases of **excess supply**:

- If there is a product surplus
- Goods will be supplied but not purchased
- This leads to the **prices falling**.
- Until they reach an equilibrium price, P' where the quantity supplied = quantity demanded.

In the cases of **excess demand**:

- There's a product shortage
- The goods will be demanded but will not be supplied
- **prices will rise**
- Eventually the prices will settle at a point P' where the quantity supplied = quantity demanded.

A **market shock** may occur:

- Would lead to a shift in demand (which affects the equilibrium price and quantity available in the market)
- There's a negative shift in the demand, i.e the average price paid for some X of product will fall such that if the market would pay £20 per product at a quantity measurement of "2" in the market, they will now pay £10 at the same quantity of measurement.
- This usually occurs during a **technological disruption** where the demand for the service/product could fall drastically.

## Laws of Economics and Changing Technology:

### Combinatorial Inventions

**New Definitions:**

**Combinatorial invention**: A technology whose rich set of components can be combined and recombined to create new products / services

The social inertia to new ways of doing things are overcome (people get used to doing new stuff), this affects the **demand**.

Innovators and manufacturers play with a set of components and come up with new ways of using them, this means the **supply** is affected.

An example of a key factor of the "combinatorial innovation" is **open source software**. This allows for a lot of innovation in new ways.

## Online Economic Activity:

- Digital goods: Are delivered online, therefore cheap (mp3s)
- Information Goods: Value of the goods is in the information it provides (google, news websites etc)
- Online purchasing of physical goods: This moves the business to business supply chain (amazon)
- Online provision of services: Affects the impact of demand and the consumer's internal pricing of theproduct.(eg spotify)

### Differences between Physical And Digital

For digital technology these are the key qualities

- Fixed upfront costs, which essentially is high costs for development
- Cheap to distribute and cheaper variable costs (any additional cost per sale is variable cost)
- Most of the production costs are sunk, i.e cannot get manhours back unlike factory which can be sold.
- No capacity constraints, which would limit the number of times something can be reproduced.

Non monetary differentiaters between these :

- Digital goods are often **experience goods**, which means that a customer doens't know the value without actually using them. This means their internal pricing could be higher or lower. But also means they cannot estimate your costs on it that easily
- **Positive network externalities** such as the network effect are often very strong. This values the product higher depending on the impact of the positive network externality.
- Search costs for a consumer are low, specifically customer aquisition costs are low.

### Effect on competition in Digital products

If two companies are competing in terms of digital cots, then their **variable costs** are near zero. This competition will drive the prices down to zero.

This however means that new companies might not be open to joining as the setup cost could be too high and they wouldn't be able to recover anything spent.

There's usually a tendency to gain a monopoly and or zero pricing.

**Zero Pricing:** The demand for a good/service/commodity is significantly greater at exactly 0, than compared to any price even slightly higher than 0.

## Disintermediation:

When the dotcom boom was happening, people predicted that the costs of small businesses selling products and services to consumers would be very low as they **wouldn't require intermediaries**.

However, as the costs of reaching customers went lower, the cost of getting their attention (converting views to clicks?) increased. This meant that a new kind of intermediary company emerged, for example Ebay and Amazon.

## Price Discrimination:

Price discrimination occurs when a seller finds a way to charge different buyers different prices, depending on their willingness to pay.

for example:

1. 1st degree pricing: Personalise the prices per person, which is hard in the physical world but easier online
2. 2nd Degree pricing: Offer the same product at different versions at different price points
3. 3rd Degree pricing: Offering different prices to different groups, for example Students.

1st degree is per person
2nd degree is focused on options
3rd degree is focused on the type of person they are.

### 1st Degree Discrimination (Personal):

The idea is that a seller would love to charge the buyer the price that gets closest to what they're willing to pay for a product. However the seller doesn't actually know the internal pricing of the buyer, therefore cannot price the object as such.

However, they should be able to learn from previous transactions and histories and provide an estimate pricing to ensure that it works.

Ex: Amazon, Orbitz that priced you more based on if you were accesing it through a Mac. This is not technically illegal.

### 2nd Price Discrimination (Versioning):

Basically provide the option for the user / customer to pick what kind of services they want. Offer these services at different prices by reducing features or adding limitations in the product.

For example, you can have games without items or you can have Spotify with no ads.

This is great as it allows a customer to build a true valuation of your product. For example they could start with a free version, then pay \$1 for a small feature and could then get hooked and pay a subscription fee of £5. This allows each user to externalise their internal pricing, but through the options available.

**However, note that if there are multiple options, sometimes people willing to pay a higher price would end up taking the lower options if it does exactly what they wanted to do**.

### 3rd Degree Price descrimination:

- Sell the product at different price points to different **groups of users**
- Example: Student Discounts, Rail Cards Etc

## Personalisation

Personalisation is the much fancier version of 1st degree pricing where the customers decide their own versions.

They pay based on the features they accumulate, and they allow the customers to create exactly what they want. People tend to choose the higher tier options when offered with different options in general leading to an economic benefit for the company.

Eg: Dell comptuers / build your own pc sites

## Bundling and Unbundling:

**Bundling is selling a number of services and products together for one price**

Like versioning it's used to sell more to customers who otherwise woulnd't have purchased.

Adding products for a company to a bundle doesn't change their internal costing, as the variable costs are minute, however to the customer who has gained more products, they would be okay paying a higher price than they wanted to, due to the added features.

Any competitor aiming to join the market and compete would have to beat the bundle prices, or find a reason to attract customers away from the bundles.

## Network Externalities / Network Effect:

If two parties trade, it has an effect on the others who had no say in the trade. This is known as an **externality**.

- Negative externalities impose **costs**
- Positive ones impose **benefit**.

A **network externality** is when buying a product or services confers indirect cost on all those who have already bought the product. This can be positive or negative

- Positive: More recharge station as electric cars increase
- Negative: Less space on roads making it worse for other car owners.

**In technology: Network effect is a lot more useful**.
Ex: - MS office, Forums, Social networks, Paypal accounts etc.

As the network increases, the demand for the network increases until a peak. At this point the demand starts reducing due to the saturation of the market or some other negative impacts (think facebook if you paid). The peak is when the users are willing to pay the highest, and this is usually around the midpoint of the supply/growth/population of the network.

People who join in the network early wouldn't have a high internal pricing of the product, requiring the companies to have a lower valuation. As the network and demand increases, that's when the internal pricing for the nproduct increases and people are willing to pay more.

A good way to build a quick network effect is the idea of using free tools and free versions. Once this network is at it's peak, you can introduce other charges or versions that could enable users to stay and capitalise on the network size. (Tinder premium // PayPal for businesses etc).

# Lecture 5&6 Economics of the Internet (MORE ECON)

## Switcing Costs and Lock-in:

Switching between different products and services can have a **switching cost**. This is things both in monetary and non monetary form, for example controls on a DVD player // buying an adapter.

Switching between things in digital world are a lot more common, and usually costs a lot (for example switching from Windows to Linux).

When switching costs are very high, buyers are said to be **locked in** to one provider.

Some sources of the switching costs are:

1. Training how to use the system
2. Network effect (leaving snapchat but all your friends are there.)
3. Setup Costs (Reset your amazon cards to use paypal isntead)
4. Reduced service or loss of information (won't get spotify / youtube recommendations on amazon video/music)

**How do you enforce a lock-in?**:
Proprietary formats are a great way of enforcing monopoly over a network of users. For example the `.doc` format!

However, this means that a competitor just needs to break in the key feature and can break in the lockin effect, For example open office with the reverse engineering of `.docx`

## Standardisation and Network Effects

Adopting an industry-wide standard allows a user network to be shared amongst providers.

- Standards allow people to share networks
- Usually leads to a bigger market but smaller market share, (more customers, but less of the monopoly on them).

1. Standards **Leader:** One player, often the major ususally stards the standard by exposing their proprietary format. (ex Adobe and pdf)
2. Standards **War**: When two competitors compete to determine which standard is to be adopted.
3. Standards **negotiation**: People negotiate a standard collectively

## How to make money when competition makes the overall system 0.

1. Paywalls (blocks users, but increases overall profits)
2. Capitalising on brand, making people _want_ to pay.
3. Sell multiple and complementary goods. (ex: people selling album CDs with tshirts on tour)

## Advertiising:

**Old school marketing on the internet**
Measured by :

1. Cost per _impression_ : Displaying
2. costs per _click_: interaction
3. costs per _lead_: selling details and hints to target customers.

**Online marketing with auction market mechanisms**:

- Providers specify where they want their ads and some budget restrictions
- The advert placement is based on page content, demographics of vistors and time of day etc.
- Advertisers bid for ads (in a robotic auction)

## Social Media

- Earned media: Anectodes on a site (ex reddit)
- Paid : Advertising

## Auctions [IMPORTANT]

They **provide a mechanism for buyers and sellers to meet and trade**

Some Types:

1. English Auction: **Open Ascending Price auction**
2. Dutch Auction: **Open descending price auction**
3. Sealed bid Auction: Bidders enter a bid to the auctioneer, and the highest bid wins. In the **first price sealed**, winners pay the price they bid, in the **second price sealed (vickery)** winner pays the second highest price.
4. **Continous double auction (CDA)**: Buyers and Sellers enter a bid/offer at any time. Commonly usesd in fin markets.

### Incentive Compatibility:

1. A first price sealed bid auction is not _incentive compatible_ : Bidder bids less tha nthey value the item at.
2. A sealed bid auction is _incentive compatible_, where bidders can bid their true valuation knowing it wont affect the price they pay.

## Online Auctions

- Ebay uses the **english auction** system.
- Ebay ended up using the vickery (second sealed) auction system with all the sniping.

## Reverse Auction:

- Suppliers bid to meet a contract
- Suppliers need to be qualified to participate

## Google Ad Auction Details:

- Largest number of auctions
- Google assigns them a price based on **Bid price X quality**
- Quality is dependent on: historic click rate, relevancy, and landing page quality and load speed of the ad.

**Quality of the ad**:
Aims to score the probability of a click through for the ad, and ensure that those who click aren't dissapointed in the ad as that would mean they wont click other ads in the future.

## Impacts of Internet Economomics:

1. Direct impact: Environmental impact
2. Indirect: Changes in behaviour that technology enables (home shopping)
3. Systemic: Changes in society, people take remote jobs
4. Social Impacts: Social media , privacy etc.

**But how do big companies with less employees impact small businesses?**

- Cost has decreased to start a business
- Businesses can reach customers faster
- Niche businesses can make more profit through online portals and payments
- Gig work (uber, deliveroo etc) can lead to more jobs.

## Do big companies pay tax?

- Tax avoidance isn't illegal
- People do fancy weird stuff to save money being spent on tax.
- Tax Evasion: Not paying tax
- Tax Avoidance: Finding loopholes and reasons to reduce tax payments

### Tax loopholes Pre 2012:

1. **Low Value Consignment Relief**: No VAT on goods under £18 sold fomr EU to Channel Islands.

Play.com, Amazon and Tesco just sold their products under £18 via the channel islands! That however was shut down :(

They did this by round tripping their DVDs to channel islands then mailing it back individually.

### Double Irish Dutch Sandwich:

- Tax loophole that allowed a lot of companies to avoid tax.
- It's closed to new companies, and will close to old companies in 2020.

The steps are as follows:

1. US company licenses it's IP to an Irish / Bermudan **holding** company (with no employees, and has tax residents in bermuda with management and control in bermuda)
2. Sublicenses this IP to a dutch holding company (no profit here, so no taxes!)
3. This sublicensies it to an irish **operational** company (which has no profits either!)
4. This irish company gets business revenue from Non-US companies, and pays royalties to the dutch company which doesn't actually pay tax by EU regulations
5. The dutch company pays royalties to the other (parent, step 2 ) irish company and doesn't pay tax by EU regulations
6. The irish/bermudan company just pays royalties to the american company that gave the original IP.

# Lecture 8: Market & Economic Agents

**Market economics is a new way of looking at how to share / allocate limited or scarce resources**.
There are two aspects

- So called Market Based Control (MBC) or Market Based Resource Allocation (BMRA).
- Provides fast, robust and distributed control for varying problemss.

It requires software versions of traders and marketplaces.

Dynamics from microeconomics can help build automated dynamic resource allocation and control in engineered systems.

## Background Economics for Markets:

1. **Demand > Supply**: Sellers' market / Shortage
2. **Supply > Demand**: Buyers' market / Surplus.
3. **Price is a function of the quantity** supplied or demanded.
4. Price that buyers are prepared to pay at each possible quantity is a **demand**, and is plotted on a demand curve.
5. The price that a seller is prepared to sell for each possible quantity is a **supply curve**. (as price increases, quantity supplied increases)

Free Markets are **self correcting:**
If the prices and transactions are taking place at prices away from equilibrium, the competition amongst buyers and sellers will move prices back towards equilibrium.

At equilibrium, traders won't change their prices as it's good for both of them.

This kind of market can give effective allocation of resources without a central controller or external intervention into the area.

A common ideal of efficient allocation is the notion of **Pareto Efficiency (PE)**:

- Allocation is PE if no-one can be made better-off without someone else being worse-off
- The PE allocations can arise from free markets even if they have characters just dealing in their self interest
- Free markets are **not guaranteed** to reach optimal allocations. (imagine a seller having a monopoly)

Traders in CDA deal with a lot of data from multiple sources and must act in real time to achieve their maximum utility.

## Economics 101 vs Reality:

There's the idea that a smooth supply and demand curve gives a theoretical equilibrium price. (imagine two lines \ and / meeting and making a tilted X).

However **in reality**:

- the CDA auction leads to a _stepped_ supply and demand "curve".
- Each step in the **supply curve** represents **an additional unit available** at the indicated price
- Each step in the **demand** curve represents an additional unit **desired** as the indicated price.
- **Buyers and Sellers will lie** in real life meaning that the percieved supply/demand may be different to the actual ones.
- **Dynamic variation** in both curve of the Supply and Demand. This happens if a buyer and trader in a small market leave the market
- This happens after **every** transaction.
- **Even without transactions, prices change**

## Experimental Economics:

- Fake buyers and sellers by giving them some cash and limits on how low they can sell or how high they can buy.
- Giving different limits to people meant that different types of supply/demand curves could be introduced into the market.
- Vernon Smith won a nobel prize for his lab style studies of human market-trading.


## Some Market Metrics:

- Smith's alpha : Root mean square deviation of transaction prices around the theoretical equilibrium price, expressed as a percentage.
- Allocative Efficiency: Total utility earned by all traders, ... **measures how effective the market is at extracting 'gains through trade'**
- Single Agent Efficiency: **measures how well an individual agent performs!**

The allocative efficiency of a market cannot be over 100%, but one of a single agent can!

### Gode and Sunder experimental studies

Gode and Sunder set a series of experiements with humans and software to see whethe the allocative efficiency came from the traders or from the market.
1. ZI- U (Zero Intelligence) Unconstrained traders quote random prices and an overall maximum price to trade. They didn't reach close to equilibrium and the market were not effective
2. ZI - C Constrained traders, quoted random prices but were told to not make a loss producing deal, and that meant they had similar results to those of humans

this proved that the intelligence of allocative efficiency came mostly from markets, but not from the humans specifically. And that allocative efficiency isn't the best measure of intellegence for traders in a market!

# Lecture 9: Market and Economic Agents II

So, are ZI-C traders all you need to make a useful market?

Nope, Dave Cliff the man had these findings in a report:

- Analysed the PDFs (Prob Density Funcs) of ZI traders and proved that Gode&Sunder's results were artefactual
- Predicted conditions when ZI-C traders would fail to equilibrate
- Implemented the ZI-trader system to empirically demonstrate failures.

**He then went on and just invented ZI-Plus traders or ZIP traders!**

- They aim to have a profit margin
- They demonstrated to succeed in markets that ZICs failed
- And they had a human like behaviour in a CDA / Retail auction

## Focusing on ZIC traders:

- ZIC sellers generate offer prices at random, in the range from min selling limit to the max price in the system.
- ZIC buyers generate an offer price at random, from the max selleerr limit down to min buying price in the system.
- The intersection in the area under the slope of these two curves gives us the **expected transaction price** estimates. The point where the two functions meet gives us an equilibrium price.

The above works well in a situation where the transaction-price prob density func is symmetric.
In a world where this is not true, you can see a place where the expected transaction price would differ significantly from the equilibrium price.

this means you'd definitely need another algorithm: Zero Intelligence Plus (ZIP)

## Informal Summary of ZIP:

- For sellers, you have a **limit price L** that's the lowest you can sell for.
- The asking price P is L plus some profit margin M.
- If you have something to sell, and your current price is P and if sellers are accepting below P or are making offers below P, then decrease M (but not below 0).
- If trades are happening at prices above P, then increase M.

Buyers run the inverse of this, and the amount you update the profit margin `M` is determined by a **learning rule** which makes the ZIP behaviour adaptive!

## Zip Trader - MOAR

- It's adaptive, i.e. sets the margin of profits up and down base on simple ML rules!
- Quote price `P` is set by the limit price `L` and the margin `M`

> P = L ( 1 + M)

The amount by which the margin is raised or lowered is determined by

- Target price (stochastic)
- learning rule ( adjust towards the profit margin )

For a **target price**, the ZIP algorithm aims for a number slightly below the last quoted if it's trying to reduce, or aims slightly above if you're trying to raise.

ZIP was actually better than humans, same with GD.

## Some nice algorithms for making money

### Kaplan's "Lurking Sniper":

- Outperformed all competition in it's contest
- Do nothing until:
  - The bid offer spread drops to a sufficiently small value
  - Offer is less than the smallest transaction price
  - there's not much time until market closes

If any of these are valid, then jump in and "steal the deal" so long as the sniper makes a profit greater than the minimum threshold.

However, it's not the best when:

- there's only snipers (since they do nothing)
- Unable to see the market's equilibrium price P_0, and therefore will snipe any deal.

### Gjerstad-Dickhaut GD traders (1998)

- Sophisticated algorithm, uses **belief function** from recent market activity.
- Calculates the belief function from a history H of n trades.
- Calculates for each bid or offer, that a bid or offer would be accepte at that price
- GD interpolates to smooth the belief function for prices that don't exist in the history
- **chose a quote price that maximises a trader's gain**. It's calculated by a product of utility gain (expected profit) and the probability of acceptance.
- A **MGD** is a modified version of GD that works for limit order books!

### GDX (GD but X)

- Uses real time dynamic programming to formulate agent bidding strategies.
- States are represented primarily by an agent's holdings and transition probabilities are estimated from the market event history.
- The above estimation is done similar to GD hence the name

### Adaptive-Aggressive algorithm (AA):

- Uses past history to estimate the current Equilibrium Price (P_0) and estimates the volatility.
- Has an aggressiveness value, and its taken into account for the calculation of a bid/offer. More aggrisvely placed ones are more likely to be accepted.
- **Aggression function**: Updated based on price volatility in the market. In a more volatile market, a small change in aggressiveness will lead to a greater change in bidding behaviour.

## How do you test these trading algorithms??

**Testing these different systems is hard analytically, so everyone just runs experiments**

- In MBRA - Market Based Resource Allocation models, you can assume that people are using the same trading algorithm.
- In Financial Markets, that's implausible / not really happening.

So, someone actually tested it on a CDA type:

1. **Homogenous population tests**: Everyone runs the same algorithm. This provides a good baseline for performance.
2. **One-in-many**: Explore vulnerability to defection / invasion in the trading algorithms. Such as imagine in a MBRA model, one of the bots swapped algorithms.
3. **Balanced Group Tests:** Buyers and sellers are evenly split between the two types of algorithms, and each has a counterpart with the other type's identical limit prices.

Some results of the algroithms being tested:

1. Kaplan is only good if there are small number of trades amongst a larger population as it relies on equilibrium in the market
2. ZIC lost to both ZIP and MGD
3. It's hard to tell a winner directly.
4. AA beat most traders (including GDX)
